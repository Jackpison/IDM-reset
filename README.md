# IDM-reset

Hi,

I had the same problem with IDM trial stopped working
Found this little workaround from here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/bq78ji/idm_popup_fake_serial/
This worked well for me so decided to share it.


I developed a script that resolves the problem and clean all IDM modifications.
it is a ".bat" file (you can open it with a text editor to understand it) try to run it as an admininstrator.

Download "subinacl.exe" (https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=23510 if not working try google for safe source), 
and put it in the same directory of the script because the script run it one time at the begining of the script.

Note: Keep subinacl.msi & resetrialidm.bat in the same folder, and run the .bat file as an administrator only.

Feel free to commit any changes to this as needed.
Enjoy!!!
